      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for
        example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make
        our Services better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide
        information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and
        from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.
      </p>

      <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>
        It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide
        to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how
        we use the information. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information
        from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require
        individuals who sign up for a BoundInWickedry.com account to provide a
        username and email address and basic business information. As we are a
        wholesaler we need this information to authenticate your business.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you buy
        something from us, you will provide additional personal and/or payment
        information that is required to process the transaction and your
        payment, such as your name, credit card information, billing and
        shipping information information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Information:</strong> If you use our Terms payment or Bill
        Me Later Services, you may also provide us with information about your
        financial status to set up a payments integration, such as your bank
        account information or other financial information to confirm your
        capability to pay in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Communications With Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also
        provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our
        Customer Support about a support question, or post a question about us
        in our twitter, facebook, or other social contact methods, if you choose
        to use them.
      </p>

      <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
      <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we
        collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers
        typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique
        device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and
        time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We
        collect log information when you use our Services - for an example, if
        you find an missing page or broken link, that error is recorded in our
        logs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your
        usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about what
        happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, the path you took
        through our site, and if you purchased or not) along with information
        about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and
        mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example,
        provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use
        our Services, so we can make our Services better.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate
        location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this
        information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our
        Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect
        information about your precise location via our mobile apps if you allow
        us to do so through your mobile device operating system's permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie
        is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
        computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each
        time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small
        blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Bound In Wickedry uses
        cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and
        track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well
        as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver
        targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other
        technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of
        cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>How And Why We Use Information</h3>
      <p>Purposes for Using Information</p>
      <p>

        listed below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To provide our Services - for example, to set up and maintain your
          account or charge you for your purchases;
        </li>
        <li>
          To further develop and improve our Services - for example by adding
          new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them
          using our Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact
          with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them
          easier to use;
        </li>
        <li>
          To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising,
          and better understand user retention and attrition - for example, we
          may analyze how many individuals made a purchase after receiving a
          marketing message or the features used by those who continue to use
          our Services after a certain length of time;
        </li>
        <li>
          To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the
          security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions
          and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and
          property of Bound In Wickedry and others, which may result in us
          declining a transaction or the use of our Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers
          and promotions offered by Bound In Wickedry and others we think will
          be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date
          on Bound In Wickedry and our products;
        </li>
        <li>
          To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content
          recommendations (for example, suggested products), target our
          marketing messages to groups of our users (for example, those who have
          purchased particular products or have been our user for a certain
          length of time).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
      <p>
        A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for
        processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is
        that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(1)</strong> The use is necessary in order to fulfill our
        commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with
        you or is necessary to administer your account - for example, in order
        to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for items
        you buy; or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(2)</strong> The use is necessary for compliance with a legal
        obligation; or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(3)</strong> The use is necessary in order to protect your vital
        interests or those of another person; or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(4)</strong> We have a legitimate interest in using your
        information - for example, to provide and update our Services, to
        improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user
        experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to
        measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and
        better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent
        any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(5)</strong> You have given us your consent - for example before
        we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them
        later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Sharing Information</h3>
      <p>How We Share Information</p>
      <p>We do not sell our users' private personal information.</p>
      <p>
        We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out
        below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong>
        We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our
        employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need
        to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to
        process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries,
        employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for
        personal information that we share with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you
        with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order
        to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you.
        This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you
        (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card
        information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze
        fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that
        help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services
        that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data
        escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services,
        those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools
        for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our
        marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our
        Services (like analytics providers). We require vendors to agree to
        privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other
        vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g. our Cookie
        Policy).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose information about you
        in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
        For more information on how we respond to requests for information about
        BoundInWickedry.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may
        disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
        Bound In Wickedry, third parties, or the public at large. For example,
        if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death
        or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the
        emergency without delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale
        of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by
        another company, or in the unlikely event that Bound In Wickedry goes
        out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be
        one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If
        any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue
        to apply to your information and the party receiving your information
        may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose
        information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may
        share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to
        do so, such as if you require us to ship product to someone besides
        yourself. In that case, your information will be printed on the shipping
        label.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Published Support Requests:</strong> And if you send us a
        request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback
        mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in a non
        personally identifying way in order to help us clarify or respond to
        your request or to help us support other users. For Example, we may add
        a question and answer to our FAQ page. Your question will not be
        associated with you in anyway.
      </p>

      <h3>Information Shared Publicly</h3>
      <p>
        Information that you choose to make public is, you guessed it, disclosed
        publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means, of course, that information like your wishlist or saved
        products lists that you make public are all available to others, this
        may help you in your business to share future buying decisions without
        having to give other employees in your business your login information
        to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by
        third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to
        make public.
      </p>

      <h3>How Long We Keep Information</h3>
      <p>
        We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the
        information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, which are
        described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information, and we
        are not legally required to continue to keep it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a
        visitor to Bound In Wickedry's websites, such as the visitor's IP
        address, browser type, and operating system, for at least 30 days. We
        retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things,
        analyze traffic to Bound In Wickedry's websites and investigate issues
        if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect
        information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
        destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring
        our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
      </p>

      <h3>Choices</h3>
      <p>
        You have several choices available when it comes to information about
        you:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limit Access to Information On Your Mobile Device:</strong> Your
        mobile device operating system should provide you with the ability to
        discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</strong> You may opt out
        of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions
        in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still
        send you other messages, like those about your account, purchases,
        shipping notifications, order status updates and legal notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> You can usually
        choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before
        using Bound In Wickedry's websites, with the drawback that certain
        features of Bound In Wickedry's websites may not function properly
        without the aid of cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While we'd be very sad to see you
        go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can close
        your BoundInWickedry.com account. Please keep in mind that we may
        continue to retain your information after closing your account, as
        described in How Long We Keep Information above, for example, when that
        information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our
        compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or
        reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Rights</h3>
      <p>
        If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under
        the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the
        “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your
        personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including
        the rights to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
        <li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
        <li>
          Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data;
          and
        </li>
        <li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your
        account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to do
        that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights,
        scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us.
      </p>
      <p>
        EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government
        supervisory authority.
      </p>

      <h3>Controllers and Responsible Companies</h3>
      <p>Bound In Wickedry's Services are offered worldwide.</p>
      <p>
        Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the
        controller of your personal data. Generally, the “controller” is Bound
        In Wickedry company that entered into the contract with you under the
        Terms of Service for the the product you buy or service you use. Third
        party tracking, shipping etc, will be under the control of those
        companies.

      <p>Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!)</p>

      <h3>Transferring Information</h3>
      <p>
        Because Bound In Wickedry's Services are offered worldwide, the
        information about you that we process when you use the Services in the
        EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by shippers operating outside
        the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, or third party data
        processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why
        We Use Information section above. When providing information about you
        to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure
        that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These
        measures include:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission
        approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they
        have signed up to the EU-US Privacy Shield; or
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA,
        entering into European Commission approved standard contractual
        arrangements with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect
        your personal information when transferring it from the EU.
      </p>

      <h3>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
      <p>
        Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services.
        These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies
        (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and
        across other websites and online services. These technologies allow
        these third parties to recognize your device to compile information
        about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and
        other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage,
        determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements
        suited to our customer base. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers
        the collection of information by Bound In Wickedry and does not cover
        the collection of information by any third party advertisers or
        analytics providers.
      </p>

      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
      <p>
        Although most changes are likely to be minor, Bound In Wickedry may
        change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Bound In Wickedry
        encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
        Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the
        change log below, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice
        (such as adding a statement to our homepage or the Seller Resources
        Blog, or sending you a notification through email or your dashboard).
        Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy
        will be subject to the updated policy.
      </p>
      <p>That's it! Thanks for reading.</p>
